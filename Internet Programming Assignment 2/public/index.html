                <p class="card-text ">Following the enormous international success of Irish cow racing events in recent weeks, Spórt Éireann are considering designating cow racing a protected sport - a decision which would have major implications for cow racing domestically and around-the-world. Protected status would unlock extra funding for groups like the Irish Cow Racing Association and allow groups like Tourism Ireland to use cow racing in their marketing material. Although cow racing is hardly unique to the island of Ireland, the internationally recognised quality of Irish cows and success of Irish cow racing events has brought about suggestions that cow racing is a natural continuation of Brehon law and Gaelic values in modern Ireland. Larry McCarthy, the Preisdent of the Gaelic Athletic Association has denied rumors that the GAA is considering absorbing cow racing into the list of indigenous Gaelic games that it promotes and administers. In an interview last Friday evening (Friday the 1st) he lambasted suggestions that cow racing could be considered a sport of national importance and indigenous Gaelic origin, claiming that "accepting cow racing as an organic part of the fabric of Irish society would do nothing but play into negative racial stereotypes about Irish people world-wide. We do not think that it's in the interest of our native population or diaspora to imply that cow racing is an especially Irish phenomenon - nor do we recognise any relation between the importance of cattle in Brehon law and the modern state of Ireland. I mean really, it's ridiculous, might as well rename the place to "Cowland". Although we understand that McCarthy's final statement was made in jest, several orgnisational officials from the Irish Cow Racing Association have shown partiality to the idea, and have signalled their willingness to bring the matter to the Dáil. This publication remains convinced that... </p>

                <h5 class="card-title ">Farmers McDonagh and Ward Cleared in Cow Doping Scandal</h5>
                <p class="card-text ">Despite protests from competitors the Irish Cow Racing Association has cleared farmers John McDonagh and Seamus Ward of allegations that they have been doping their cows Muire, and Aoibheann with anabolic steroids and protein powder. Suspicion of the farmer's use of illicit dietary supplements and black-market steroids arose following their exemplary performance in 2020's Cow-Racing-for-Covid Tournament, and were re-affirmed following McDonagh's unbelievable grand slam racing performances in the 2021 Summer Solstice Cow Derby, however following the release of the Irish Cow Racing Association's long awaited "Steroid Usage in Irish Cow Racing" report the two have been entirely cleared of their alledged wrong-doings. When asked to comment McDonagh claimed that "the glass down in Tipp is greener and heartier than that tripe they're feeding them up in Meath" and lamented the loss of privacy that he and Muire had experienced in the preceding months. We have reached out to Ward, who has declined to comment any farther on the issue - reiterating that "Cow racing is about the bond between farmer and cow, perhaps there are other farmers who need to reconsider how they treat their cows". Ward's history of inflammatory remarks...</p>
